# Fix Errors - TODO

## Plan:
1. [x] Fix invalid orphaned `body` rule at top of styles.css (remove lines 1-3)
2. [x] Fix image path in `.stars-overlay` (stars.png → stars.svg)
3. [x] Verify fixes by running the application

## Completed:
- Fixed invalid CSS by removing orphaned `body { background-color: red !important; }` rule at the top of styles.css
- Fixed image path: changed `stars.png` to `stars.svg` in `.stars-overlay` class
- Verified fixes are correctly applied
